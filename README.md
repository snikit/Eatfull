# Eatfull

As soon as I read the assignment , I was reminded of the Knapsack algorithm . The query was similar to that of weight - value example that I had done while I was practising algos way back I guess in Btech .

I didn't remeber the algo soultion exactly so had to search for it on google.

Got the algo then used it to get the solution .

Rest everything was simple ->
- created a common utility for the algo
- one service class to handle Gordon :p i.e to read data from file then pass to above utlity
- created custom exception to wrap all runtime exceptions thrown by Scanner 
- used command line runner to execute the query


<h1> To run use command <b>gradlew -DFILE=<filepath> bootRun </b></h1>
